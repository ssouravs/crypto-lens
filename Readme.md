- **Price Table**: Displays price data in a responsive table format.
- **Dark Mode**: The application has a dark mode background for better usability in low-light environments.

## Technologies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or yarn (v1 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-lens-client.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd crypto-lens-client
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

### Setting Up the Proxy

To avoid CORS errors during development, a proxy is configured in `package.json`. The proxy routes API requests to your backend server.

- The `proxy` field in `package.json` should be set to the URL of your backend server.

**Example:**

```json
"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
```

Replace `http://localhost:5000` with your backend server's URL.

### Building for Production

1. Build the application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. The build artifacts will be generated in the `build` directory. You can serve these files using a static file server or deploy them to a hosting provider.

### API Endpoints

The application expects the following API endpoint for fetching price data:

- `GET /api/prices/:symbol` - Retrieves price data for a given cryptocurrency symbol.

### Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. For more details on how to customize the styles, refer to the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
